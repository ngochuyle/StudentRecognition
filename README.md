# StudentRecognition
Welcome to my project repository! This project is an application that integrates knowledge acquired at HTW (University of Applied Sciences) along with insights gained during internship periods. My focus lies in addressing a specific issue: "student attendance tracking through facial recognition." I've developed a website to fulfill this function, incorporating applications and features for student management, exams, and facial recognition-based attendance tracking.

## Algorithm Overview:

I tackle the facial recognition task using the following algorithms:
- MTCNN: Detects faces in images.
- Facenetz: Extracts features into vectors.
- Cosine Similarity: Compares two vectors.
Detailed algorithmic theory can be found in Document A.

## Technologies Used:

In addition to facial recognition theories, essential technologies for web application development include:
- Frontend: VueJS, VueX, Vue Router (located in ./template/).
- Python and Pytorch library: Implements facial recognition algorithms (located in ./server-anwendung/python/).
- Database: MySQL.
- Backend: Java along with technologies such as Java Spring Boot and Spring Security.
During backend development, emphasis was placed on object-oriented programming, MVC model for designing and creating APIs to serve the web application. Additionally, the project incorporates communication mechanisms between Java and Python via ProcessBuilder. I also apply simple design patterns like Singleton pattern and Builder.
